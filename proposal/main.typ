Our intention is to accomplish the following goals:

- *Rewrite the Amy compiler frontend in Rust.* This will allow us to establish a separate codebase that we are more familiar with, make sure it is clean and consistent, and to revisit the implementation of the frontend.

- *Implement parametric polymorphism for functions and ADT's.* Currently, the Amy language is hard to use, in part because it lacks polymorphism. The `Option` class of the `Std` module only supports integer values, whereas one would often desire a parameterized `Option[A]` type. Similarly, one would desire a `List[A]` construct and a way to write polymorphic functions. We aim to extend Amy with the following syntax:
  ```scala
  // A class parameterized by type variables A_1, ..., A_n
  abstract class T[A_1, A_2, ..., A_n]

  // Constructors may take arguments of types A_1, ..., A_n.
  case class C1 (a_1: A_1, ..., a_m: A_m) extends T
  case class C2 (b_1: A_1, ..., b_k: A_k) extends T

  // Funstions may be parametrically polymorphic
  def fun[A_1, ..., A_n, A] (a_1: A_1, ..., a_l: A_l): A := ... end fun
  ```
  For example,
  ```scala
  abstract class List[A]
  case class Nil() extends List
  case class Cons(h: A, t: List[A]) extends List

  def length[A] (lst: List[A]): Int(32) := lst match {
    case Nil() => 0
    case Cons(h, t) => 1 + length(t)
  }
  end length
  ```
  Values may also have polymorphic types:
  ```scala
  Nil() : forall A. List[A]
  ```
  Pattern matching on values typed as `forall A. A` will be _disallowed_, since this type yields no information about the value.
